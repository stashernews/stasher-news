// Rewards hot-wallet signer (Phase 4 Task 9 / design spec §5.6, §6.2).
//
// The ONLY component in the running stack that holds the platform rewards
// wallet's SPEND key. It opens a full (spend-capable) MoneroWalletWasm from the
// view+spend keys in env (kept in memory for the worker process lifetime), then
// sends each QUEUED RewardPayout as a real on-chain Monero tx, records the tx
// hash, and flips the payout QUEUED -> SENT (confirmFinalizer later matures
// SENT -> CONFIRMED at N confirmations).
//
// Fund-safety rules (see task-9 brief + design spec):
//   - keys are read from env and NEVER logged / serialized;
//   - sending requires UNLOCKED funds — recently-received outputs are locked
//     ~10 blocks, so an insufficient unlocked balance is a SKIP (payout stays
//     QUEUED, retried next run), NOT a FAILED (FAILED is for hard errors only);
//   - a hard createTx error marks the batch FAILED, but the funds stay in the
//     wallet (no loss of principal); a CRITICAL alert + manual reconciliation
//     re-enters them into a future pool (FAILED payouts are counted in
//     distributedPiconeros, so they do not auto-roll into next week's pool);
//   - a pre-relay "tx not possible" build failure is a retryable SKIP: the whole
//     bucket stays QUEUED (nothing was broadcast — double-pay-safe) and the
//     next drive re-sends; recovery consolidation only fires when it can
//     actually help (see sendPayouts);
//   - every relayed bucket/consolidation is journaled BEFORE its relay (Task 6
//     boundary); an attempted-but-unproven relay is never blindly re-sent and
//     never marks a recipient FAILED — it is resolved only from exact-hash
//     wallet history. During genuine shortage the largest affordable whole
//     payouts are sent and the remainder stays an explicit QUEUED debt;
//
// Daemon = monerod (MONEROD_URL), NOT lws: signing needs real ringCT decoys
// which the light wallet scanner cannot serve.

//     FAILED-resumable, never COMPLETE with an unrecorded relay.

//     an already-relayed tx is a real double pay); the next run with a

// more sequential createTx on the SAME singleton wallet, strictly AFTER
// sendPayouts returns — never concurrent, never a second wallet, so no
// same-output double-spend (monero-ts marks an input spent in-memory the
// instant a tx relays).
//
// Ops may only sweep what is genuinely theirs. Before any wallet relay the
// sweep reconciles the journal from exact-hash wallet history and refuses when
// accounting is unresolved, then reads ONE consistent DB snapshot (ledger +
// next pool + all-time inflow) and bounds the whole run by:
//   B = min( corrected ops carry, unlocked - outstanding reward principal -
//            next pool - standing fee reserve )
// where `corrected ops` is the completed distribution's opsAvailable less the
// ledger-proven swept principal less network costs past its checkpoint, and B
// covers principal PLUS real fees. The snapshot is re-read before every account
// build and the effective budget is the smaller of the remaining original cap
// and the fresh cap. Each account's tx is built with createTx({relay: false})
// so its REAL fee is known before anything moves; a fee that would overflow the
// budget shrinks the principal by exactly the excess and is revalidated, and a
// balance error keeps the bounded headroom decrement. Exhaustion defers — it is
// never permission to exceed the budget.
//
// Every relay is journaled FIRST (kind OPS_SWEEP, metadata { destination }, the
// exact principal and fee) and only the original validated object is relayed;
// opsSweptPiconeros records PRINCIPAL ONLY (the fee is a journal expense). An
// uncertain relay stops all further account sweeps and leaves the journal
// attempt unresolved, blocking the next sweep until wallet history proves the
// outcome — an unknown send is never treated as safely unbroadcast. Relay-
// before-persist: a relayed tx hash is captured the instant the relay succeeds
// and logged before any DB write, so it is never silently lost; a persist
// failure retries once then logs CRITICAL (manual reconciliation) rather than
// flipping FAILED — FAILED means funds STAYED in the wallet, which a post-relay
// persist blip does not satisfy.
//
// `wallet` is injectable for unit tests; production leaves it unset and reuses
// the getRewardsWallet() singleton.

// and real-fee budget adjustments share this cap, so exhaustion is a safe
