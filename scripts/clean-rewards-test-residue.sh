# One-shot dev-DB cleanup of residue left by the real-DB integration tests
# (test/worker/rewardsDistributor.test.js and the RUN_STAGENET_INTEGRATION=1
# suite test/integration/rewards-distribution-stagenet.test.js). Interrupted
# runs (killed process, container restart, beforeAll throw) skip their afterAll
# teardown, leaving CONFIRMED FeeObservation/ObservedTip/ObservedDownvote rows,
# RewardDistribution/Earn/RewardPayout rows, MoneroAccounts and empty-name test
# users behind — which inflates (or, once a test distribution exists, zeroes)
# the /rewards pool display.
#
# Run after any test-suite run that left residue behind:
#   ./scripts/clean-rewards-test-residue.sh
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run on a clean DB (deletes nothing). Deletes ONLY
# test-identifiable rows:
#   * observations with test txHash prefixes (rdfee / rdtip / rddv /
#     dist-test-tip- / dist-test-downvote-)
#   * distributions: the test's "prior" shape (1e12 pool, 0 distributed,
#     COMPLETE), any distribution with a fake-sent payout (txHash = 'ab'*32,
#     the test signer), and any distribution whose Earn/payouts reference test
#     (empty-name) users — real distributions reference named users
#   * orphan Earn rows (distributionId IS NULL)
#   * MoneroAccounts: the makeAddress signature (address ends in 90 'A's),
#     accounts referenced by test tips, accounts owned by test users
#   * users with NULL name (created by the tests via INSERT ... DEFAULT VALUES)
#     and their remaining PayIns/Items
# REAL rows are never matched by these patterns (verified against the dev DB).
# If a real distribution ever runs (cron, Monday 00:00 UTC), its payouts carry
# real tx hashes and its Earn references named users, so it is NOT deleted.
