#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Daily offsite mirror to Backblaze B2 (bucket: stashernews-backups).
#
# VPS-ONLY by construction: refuses to run unless /etc/stashernews/secrets.env
# exists (a path that only exists on the production box) — a dev machine can
# never push to B2, intentionally.
#
# Retention model: every leg uses `rclone copy` (never sync/delete). The
# remote only accumulates, and the bucket's lifecycle rule (delete after 90
# days) is the single retention mechanism. This deliberately avoids ALL
# delete operations, because the bucket has Object Lock (14-day default
# retention) and delete attempts on locked files fail by design.
#
# rclone remotes required (configure once via `rclone config`; see the ops
# handoff / AGENTS.md):
#   b2-stasher — Backblaze B2, application key scoped to stashernews-backups
#   localstack — S3-compatible remote for the `aws` container
#                (endpoint http://localhost:4566, path style, dummy creds)
#
# Legs:
#   1. GPG-encrypted DB dumps        $BACKUPS_DIR    -> backups/
#   2. GPG-encrypted master-key escrow $MASTERKEY_DIR -> masterkey/
#   3. SOPS-encrypted secrets.env    $SECRETS_FILE   -> secrets/
#   4. user-uploaded media           localstack:$MEDIA_BUCKET -> media/
#
# WAL archiving stays on its own hourly job (scripts/backup-wal-offsite.sh).
#
# Recommended cron (root, on the VPS; 03:40 UTC — after the 03:00 dbBackup):
#   40 3 * * * /opt/stashernews/scripts/backup-offsite.sh >> /var/log/offsite-backup.log 2>&1
