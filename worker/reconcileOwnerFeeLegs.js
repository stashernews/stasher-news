// Cron-owned backstop for owner-routed fee legs (the eighth money-observation
// chain). The lws tx-confirmation webhook is primary; this chain self-heals:
//   - a missed 0-conf callback (deploy restart across the confirmation
//     window): re-observes receipts via lws and re-runs the cumulative gate,
//     flipping PENDING_FEE items before abandonFeeItems strikes at 1 day;
//   - a missed N-conf callback: backfills the receipt + height (always at
//     confirmations 0 — never fabricated; the confirmFinalizer ObservedSubFee
//     pass matures height-bearing DETECTED rows with exact counts);
//   - a WRONG-PID lws row (mainnet incident 2026-10-08): monero-lws decrypts
//     an encrypted payment id ONCE per scan pass — with the first matching
//     registered account's derivation — and stores those bytes on every
//     matching account's row. When the payer is also lws-registered and scans
//     first, the owner's row carries the payer-side decryption: the webhook
//     never fires and the served-pid match finds nothing. The raw-decrypt
//     fallback (mirroring reconcilePendingTips) fetches the raw txs from
//     monerod and decrypts the encrypted pid with the OWNER's view key
//     (api/monero/pidDecrypt.js) — cryptographic proof of addressing — then
//     replays through the same self-send refusal + shared applier.
// Fee legs differ from tips in one load-bearing way: a leg allows MULTIPLE
// top-up txs under one payment id, so discovery must inspect EVERY remaining
// transaction row — a served-pid hit for one receipt must not stop the search.
// Raw discovery is attribution-only: the amount/height still come from the
// owner account's lws row (a raw extra proves the pid, never the RingCT
// amount), and every receipt keeps the applier's provisional-height discipline.
// Never self-requeues — a failed run heals at the next hourly cron tick.

// The single receipt path shared by served-pid matches and raw-decrypt
// matches. Extracted so both paths keep byte-identical money effects:
// idempotent applier call, issued-pid binding, exact self-send refusal
// (foreign-index spent_outputs stay legitimate). Returns the applier result,
// or null when the self-send ban refused the receipt.
