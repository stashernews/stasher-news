// confirmFinalizer — matures provisional tips (Task 7 / spec §5.5, Q5).
//
// moneroIndexer records each observed tip as DETECTED the moment lws first
// reports it (0-conf), and applyTipDetected (Task 5) has ALREADY bumped the
// post's ranking columns at that point — DETECTED credit is provisional. A
// tip becomes final once it is buried under REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS (10) blocks
// (spec Q7: Monero reorgs are shallow, so 10 confs is effectively final).
//
// This job is the counterpart that flips the mature ones DETECTED -> CONFIRMED.
// It reads the current chain height from monerod (get_info) ONCE per run (one
// daemon call per run — never per tip), scans DETECTED ObservedTips
// whose height is set (mempool tips have height == null and cannot be
// confirmed yet), and for each mature tip flips state and bumps the author's
// stackedPiconeros lifetime-received denorm (spec Q5: stackedPiconeros = sum
// of CONFIRMED ObservedTip.piconeros, mirroring SN's stackedMsats).
//
// NULL-height backstop: a tip detected at 0-conf (daemon level) is left
// DETECTED with height NULL, and if every later mined webhook is lost nothing
// scans it (the maturity scans require height NOT NULL; reconcilePendingTips
// and webhookMissCheck are PENDING-only) — until the 48h stale sweep reverses
// it. runConfirmFinalizerOnce therefore runs a bounded pass over DETECTED
// height-NULL tips older than DETECTED_NULL_HEIGHT_BACKSTOP_AGE_MS and
// re-checks them through recheckDetectedTip (anchored-hash lookup: backfill
// height, correct the amount, defer, or corroborated exclusion). The pass runs
// AFTER the credit pass and never credits: a backfilled row matures on a later
// tick through the normal height-not-null pass.
//
// ATOMICITY (deliberate): the state flip and the author denorm bump run in a
// SINGLE Prisma $transaction. Unlike a create+side-effect split (which has a
// known partial-failure hazard elsewhere), the flip+denorm here must never
// diverge — a CONFIRMED tip with an unbumped author (or vice versa) would
// desync the reputation calc. The transaction guarantees they commit together.
//
// Scope: ObservedTip, FeeObservation, ObservedSubFee, AND ObservedDownvote. The
// tip flip is coupled to the author stackedPiconeros denorm (atomic); the fee,
// sub-fee (turf-owner), and downvote flips are ledger-only. Downvote penalties
// are applied by the shared NULL->height transition (applyDownvoteTransition),
// not here; fee/sub-fee gating effects apply at DETECTION.
// Reorg reversal is NOT implemented — deferred as an accepted v1 limitation
// (consistent with the tip flow; a >10-block Monero reorg is negligible).
//
// ObservedBounty is the EXCEPTION to "ledger-only": a bounty funding whose
// webhook N-conf CONFIRMED callback was missed (e.g. the pid-map gate bug behind
// item 2808) must not stay provisional. The finalizer runs driveBountyFunding —
// the SAME funding effects as the webhook CONFIRMED path (Item -> FUNDED with
// the fee terms frozen on the Item; no hot-wallet cash row) — so the funding
// completes even when no callback ever fired. It also reconciles lws receipts
// for still-short DETECTED bounties (and backfills a NULL height from lws when
// every callback was missed). See backfillNullBountyHeights.
//
// This module exports FOUR things (mirrors worker/moneroIndexer.js):
//   - runConfirmFinalizerOnce: the testable per-run core (no pg-boss). Takes
//     injectable daemonClient + lwsClient so tests never touch the network.
//   - backfillNullBountyHeights: the lws reconcile helper for still-short
//     DETECTED bounties (receipt folding + NULL-height resolution; exported
//     for unit testing).
//   - backfillNullObservationHeights: the lws height-resolution helper for
//     NULL-height poll-detected DETECTED ObservedDownvote/FeeObservation rows
//     (exported for unit testing).
//   - confirmFinalizer: the pg-boss handler. Runs the core once; recurrence
//     is cron-owned (pgboss.schedule row confirmFinalizer, every 60s).

// Bounded batch so the job stays latency-bounded even if a large backlog of
// DETECTED tips accrues (e.g. a long lws outage followed by catch-up). 500 is
// well above any realistic per-block tip volume and leaves headroom; the next
// poll picks up the overflow. Pagination by cursor is unnecessary because the
// query is state-filtered (DETECTED) and DETECTED rows only shrink over time.
const SCAN_BATCH_SIZE = 500

// Smaller bound for the NULL-height tip backstop: each scanned tip costs an
// lws lookup (and possibly a monerod corroboration), and this pass heals an
// exceptional condition (lost webhook chain), not a normal flow. 100/run at
// the 60s cadence drains any realistic backlog within a few ticks.
