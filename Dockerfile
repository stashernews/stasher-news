USER apprunner

# node_modules is bind-mounted from the host in local dev, shared by app and
# worker. npm ci deletes and reinstalls the whole tree, so it only runs when
# node_modules is missing/incomplete or package-lock.json changed since the
# last install (stamped in .npm-installed-stamp). An unconditional reinstall
# on every start wipes the shared tree mid-flight and can kill the worker
# container (observed: Cannot find module tsx/dist/preflight.cjs, all pg-boss
# jobs dead until a manual worker restart).
# migrate deploy is non-interactive (migrate dev prompts on drift and hangs in a
# non-tty container); run migrate dev manually via `./sndev prisma migrate dev`
# prisma generate runs on EVERY boot: schema-only migrations leave
# package-lock.json unchanged, so the npm ci above is skipped and
# @prisma/client's postinstall never regenerates the client — while migrate
# deploy still applies the new column, and every query touching it then dies
# with PrismaClientValidationError (observed 2026-08-16: DownvotePidMap
# webhookEventId broke downvote creation + hourly webhookCleanup on the VPS).
# generate is idempotent (~5-10 s) and needs no DB connection.
